# About Sake

Sake is designed for **Swift developers** who prefer to stay within the familiar **Swift ecosystem** for managing command execution, rather than switching to shell scripting or using tools like Make. Sake provides features **inspired by tools like Make**, such as dependency management and conditional execution, but with the added benefits of using Swift, such as type safety, code reuse, and seamless integration.
