# Shell Completion

## Shell-Runned Completion

Sake supports shell completion for streamlined command usage. To enable shell completion, follow the installation instructions provided in the [Swift Argument Parser documentation](https://apple.github.io/swift-argument-parser/documentation/argumentparser/installingcompletionscripts/#Installing-Zsh-Completions).

With shell completion configured, you can use `Tab` to auto-complete available commands, including built-in Sake commands and custom ones defined in your Sake project.

### Built-in Sake Commands

```shell
$ sake <Tab>
build  -- Manually trigger a rebuild of the SakeApp. This is typically unnecessary, but can be used to "warm up" the build if needed.
clean  -- Remove all build artifacts generated by the SakeApp to ensure a clean state for future builds.
help   -- Show subcommand help information.
init   -- Initialize a new SakeApp project template for defining commands.
list   -- List all available commands defined in the SakeApp.
run    -- Run the specified command from the SakeApp.
```

### User Commands

::: info Note

Command listing will only work if SakeApp has already been built.

:::

```shell
$ sake run <Tab>
check    lint    build    test
```

Pressing `Tab` immediately after `sake run` (without typing any characters) will list all available user-defined commands. In this example, `check`, `lint`, `build`, and `test` are custom commands defined in your Sake project.

### Auto-completing a Partial Command

```shell
$ sake run che<Tab>
$ sake run check
```

Here, typing `che` followed by `Tab` auto-completes to `check`, assuming `check` is a defined command.

This feature enhances the usability of Sake by making command discovery and execution faster and more efficient.

## Fig Completion

Sake also supports Fig completion, which is a popular shell completion tool for modern shells. To enable Fig completion, follow the instructions provided in the [Fig documentation](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete).
