# Editing Commands

All commands in Sake are part of the Swift Package Manager (SPM) package called **SakeApp**, which is created when you [initialize a Sake project](/getting-started). You can find **SakeApp** in the root directory of your project.

To edit commands, open the **SakeApp** package in your preferred code editor, such as Xcode, and make the necessary modifications. You can add new commands, modify existing ones, or refactor command logic using the familiar tools and workflows that you use for any other Swift project.

After making changes to your commands, Sake will automatically rebuild the project the next time you run a command, ensuring that your modifications are applied.

### Testing Changes

Once you've edited the commands, you can test your changes using Xcode or run `swift build` from the command line to verify that everything compiles correctly.
